Last week: Debugging 
===

- Debugging involves diagnosing your code when you encounter an error or unexpected behavior
    * Step 0: Reproduce the error
    * Step 1: Characterize the error
    * Step 2: Localize the error
    * Step 3: Modify the code
- `traceback()`, `cat()`, `print()`: manual debugging tools
- `browser()`: interactive debugging tool
- Testing involves writing additional code to ensure your functions behave as expected
- Compared to debugging, it is proactive, rather than reactive
- `assert_that()`, `test_that()`: tools for assertions and unit tests
- **Important**: it's hard to teach good coding practices. The best way to learn is to implement these yourself from now onward!

What is a database?
===

It helps define a few things "from the ground up":

- A **field** is a variable/quantity of interest 
- A **record** is a collection of **fields**
- A **table** is a collection of records which all have the same fields (with different values)
- A **database** is a collection of tables

Databases versus data frames
===

Data frames in R are tables in database lingo

R jargon | Database jargon
--------|----------------
column  | field
row     | record
data frame | table
types of the columns | table schema
collection of data frames | database

Why do we need database software?
===

- **Size**
    - R keeps its data frames in memory
    - Industrial databases can be much bigger
    - Must work with selected subsets
    
- **Speed**
    - Smart people have worked very hard making relational databases efficient 
    - (Like 2014 Turing award winner Michael Stonebraker!)
    
- **Concurrency**
    - Many users accessing the same database simultaneously
    - Potential for trouble (two users want to change the same record at once)
    
Client-server model and SQL
===

- Databases live on a **server**, which manages them
- Users interact with the server through a **client** program
- Lets multiple users access the same database simultaneously
- **SQL** (**structured query language**) is the standard for database software
- Most basic actions are **queries**, like row/column selections on an R data frame
- SQLite is a simpler, file-based system that we will be working with this week

Connecting R to SQLite
===

SQL is its own language, independent of R. For simplicity, we're going to learn how to run SQL queries through R

First, we need to install the packages `DBI`, `RSQLite`, then we load them into our R session with `library()`

Also, we need a database file: to run the following examples, download the file up at https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~arinaldo/Teaching/36350/F22/data/lahman2016.sqlite, and save it in your R working directory

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
drv = dbDriver("SQLite")
con = dbConnect(drv, dbname="lahman2016.sqlite")
```

The object `con` is now a persistent connection to the database `lahman2016.sqlite`

Listing what's available
===

```{r}
dbListTables(con) # List tables in our database 
dbListFields(con, "Batting") # List fields in Batting table
dbListFields(con, "Pitching") # List fields in Pitching table
```

Importing a table as a data frame
===

```{r}
batting = dbReadTable(con, "Batting") 
class(batting) 
dim(batting)
```

Now we could go on and perform R operations on `batting`, since it's a data frame

This week, we'll use this route primarily to check our work in SQL; in general, should try to do as much in SQL as possible, since it's more efficient and can be simpler

`SELECT`
===

Main tool in the SQL language: `SELECT`, which allows you to perform queries on a particular table in a database. It has the form:

```
SELECT columns 
  FROM table
  WHERE condition
  GROUP BY columns
  HAVING condition
  ORDER BY column [ASC | DESC]
  LIMIT offset, count;
```

`WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT` are all optional 

Examples
===

To pick out five columns from the table "Batting", and only look at the first 10 rows:

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, paste("SELECT playerID, yearID, AB, H, HR",
                      "FROM Batting",
                      "LIMIT 10"))
```

This is our very first successful SQL query (congratulations!)

---

To replicate this simple command on the imported data frame:

```{r}
batting[1:10, c("playerID", "yearID", "AB", "H", "HR")]
```

(Note: this was simply to check our understanding, and we wouldn't actually want to do this on a large database, since it'd be much more inefficient to first read into an R data frame, and then call R commands)

`ORDER BY`
===

We can use the `ORDER BY` option in `SELECT` to specify an ordering for the rows

Default is ascending order; add `DESC` for descending

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, paste("SELECT playerID, yearID, AB, H, HR",
                      "FROM Batting",
                      "ORDER BY HR DESC",
                      "LIMIT 10"))
```

<span style="color: blue">Part II</span>
===

<span style="color: blue">*SQL computations*</span>

`SELECT`, expanded
===

In the first line of `SELECT`, we can directly specify computations that we want performed

```
SELECT columns or computations
  FROM table
  WHERE condition
  GROUP BY columns
  HAVING condition
  ORDER BY column [ASC | DESC]
  LIMIT offset, count;
```

Main tools for computations: `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`

Examples
===

To calculate the average number of homeruns, and average number of hits:

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, paste("SELECT AVG(HR), AVG(H)",
                      "FROM Batting"))
```

To replicate this simple command on an imported data frame:

```{r}
mean(batting$HR, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(batting$H, na.rm=TRUE)
```

`GROUP BY`
===

We can use the `GROUP BY` option in `SELECT` to define aggregation groups

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, paste("SELECT playerID, AVG(HR)",
                      "FROM Batting",
                      "GROUP BY playerID",
                      "ORDER BY AVG(HR) DESC",
                      "LIMIT 10"))
```

(Note: the order of commands here matters; try switching the order of `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`, you'll get an error)

`AS`
===

We can use `AS` in the first line of `SELECT` to rename computed columns 

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, paste("SELECT yearID, AVG(HR) as avgHR",
                      "FROM Batting",
                      "GROUP BY yearID",
                      "ORDER BY avgHR DESC",
                      "LIMIT 10"))
```

`WHERE`
===

We can use the `WHERE` option in `SELECT` to specify a subset of the rows to use (*pre-aggregation/pre-calculation*)

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, paste("SELECT yearID, AVG(HR) as avgHR",
                      "FROM Batting",
                      "WHERE yearID >= 1990",
                      "GROUP BY yearID",
                      "ORDER BY avgHR DESC",
                      "LIMIT 10"))
```

`HAVING`
===

We can use the `HAVING` option in `SELECT` to specify a subset of the rows to display (*post-aggregation/post-calculation*)

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, paste("SELECT yearID, AVG(HR) as avgHR",
                      "FROM Batting",
                      "WHERE yearID >= 1990",
                      "GROUP BY yearID",
                      "HAVING avgHR >= 4",
                      "ORDER BY avgHR DESC"))
```

<span style="color: blue">Part III</span>
===

<span style="color: blue">*SQL joins*</span>

`SELECT`, expanded
===

In the second line of `SELECT`, we can specify more than one data table using `JOIN`

```
SELECT columns or computations
  FROM tabA JOIN tabB USING(key)
  WHERE condition
  GROUP BY columns
  HAVING condition
  ORDER BY column [ASC | DESC]
  LIMIT offset, count;
```

`JOIN`
===

There are 4 options for `JOIN`

- `INNER JOIN` or `JOIN`: retain just the rows each table that match the condition
- `LEFT OUTER JOIN` or `LEFT JOIN`: retain all rows in the first table, and just the rows in the second table that match the condition
- `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` or `RIGHT JOIN`: retain just the rows in the first table that match the condition, and all rows in the second table
- `FULL OUTER JOIN` or `FULL JOIN`: retain all rows in both tables

Fields that cannot be filled in are assigned NA values

---

It helps to visualize the join types:

Examples
===

Suppose we want to figure out the average salaries of the players with the top 10 highest homerun averages. Then we'd have to combine the two tables below

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, paste("SELECT yearID, teamID, lgID, playerID, HR",
                      "FROM Batting", 
                      "ORDER BY playerID",
                      "LIMIT 10"))

dbGetQuery(con, paste("SELECT *",
                      "FROM Salaries",
                      "ORDER BY playerID",
                      "LIMIT 10"))
```

---

We can use a `JOIN` on the pair: `yearID`, `playerID`

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, paste("SELECT yearID, playerID, salary, HR",
                      "FROM Batting JOIN Salaries USING(yearID, playerID)",
                      "ORDER BY playerID",
                      "LIMIT 10"))
```

Note that here we're missing 3 David Aardsma's records (i.e., the `JOIN` discarded 3 records)

---

We can replicate this using `merge()` on imported data frames:

```{r}
batting = dbReadTable(con, "Batting") 
salaries = dbReadTable(con, "Salaries") 
merged = merge(x=batting, y=salaries, by.x=c("yearID","playerID"), 
               by.y=c("yearID","playerID"))
merged[order(merged$playerID)[1:10], 
       c("yearID", "playerID", "salary", "HR")]
```

---

For demonstration purposes, we can use a `LEFT JOIN` on the pair: `yearID`, `playerID`

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, paste("SELECT yearID, playerID, salary, HR",
                      "FROM Batting LEFT JOIN Salaries USING(yearID, playerID)",
                      "ORDER BY playerID",
                      "LIMIT 10"))
```

Now we can see that we have all 9 of David Aardsma's original records from the Batting table (i.e., the `LEFT JOIN` kept them all, and just filled in an NA value when it was missing his salary)

Currently, `RIGHT JOIN` and `FULL JOIN` are not implemented in the `RSQLite` package

---

Now, as to our original question (average salaries of the players with the top 10 highest homerun averages):

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, paste("SELECT playerID, AVG(HR), AVG(salary)",
                      "FROM Batting JOIN Salaries USING(yearID, playerID)",
                      "GROUP BY playerID",
                      "ORDER BY Avg(HR) DESC",
                      "LIMIT 10"))
```
