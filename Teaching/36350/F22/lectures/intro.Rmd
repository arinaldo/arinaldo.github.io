Why statisticians learn to program
===

- **Coding is an essential, integral component of data analysis**: coding, along with basic knowledge of statistical principles and methods, has become a basic form of **modern-day literacy,** not just in scientific and academic circles, but in real life. It is extremely likely (nearly certain) that, at your next job interview,  you will need to demonstrate adequate coding skills and that coding will be an integral part of your job as a statistician/data scientist, whatever that may be.  **In addition to R, consider learning other languages: Pyhton for data science and julia for scientific computing.**
- **Independence**: otherwise, you rely on someone else giving you exactly the right tool.
- **Honesty**: otherwise, you end up distorting your problem to match the tools you have.
 - **Reproducibility**: make your code public so that others can replicate your anakysis and arrive at the same finding.
- **Clarity**: often, turning your ideas into something a machine can do refines your thinking.


Cool example: shiny documents

Cool example: catching an intruder 
===

This is a very nice problem suggested as an example by [Prof. Ryan Tibshirani](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/ryan-tibshirani). 

Assume a $n \times n$ grid of empty squares, with an intruder hiding behind a square, unknown to us.  At each time point:


-  the intruder will randomly choose to stay put or to move to any of the the adjacent squares (up, down, left or right, if applicable);
- we scan all the $n^2$ squares simultaneously using a faulty device: if a square hides the intruder the device will correctly indicate so, but if the square is empty the device will incorrectly report that it is occupied with probability $p \in [0,1]$, independently across squares and across times.   

**Our goal is to locate the intruder.** Notice that, as times goes by, using brute force we are able to dynamically maintain a list of potential locations for the intruder, with the size of the list fluctuating over time.  (Coding exercise: how would create and update such list?) 

![](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~arinaldo/Teaching/36350/F22/lectures/intruder.png)

There are several questions we could ask:

- will this list eventually shrink in size to reduce to only one entry, which will identify the location of the intruder?
- how long would this process take?
- what is the impact of the grid size parameter $n$ and of the probability parameter $p$  on the probability of eventually catching the intruder and on the amount of time (number of time steps) before this happens?
- is there a better (more efficient and/or more accurate) algorithm than the natural one described above?

We can deploy simulations to attempt to tackle the above questions. Absent any theoretical answers (which, to the best of my knowledge, have not been worked out yet), that is the best we can do. Take a look at the R code used for simulations, written by [Prof. Ryan Tibshirani](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/ryan-tibshirani). By the end of this course (in fact, hopefully sooner) you should be able to read and understand it.

```{r}
source("https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~arinaldo/Teaching/36350/F22/lectures/intruder.R")
intruder.sim(n=30, p=0.1)
#intruder.sim(n=50, p=0.2, dt=0.1)
#intruder.sim(n=50, p=0.3, dt=0.1)
```

<span style="color: blue">*Data types, operators, variables*</span>

This class in a nutshell: functional programming
===

Two basic types of things/objects: **data** and **functions**

- **Data**: things like 7, "seven", $7.000$, and $\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 7 & 7 & 7 \\ 7 & 7 & 7\end{array}\right]$
- **Functions**: things like `log`, `+` (takes two arguments), `<` (two), `%%` (two), and `mean` (one)

> A function is a machine which turns input objects, or **arguments**, into an output object, or a **return value** (possibly with side effects), according to a definite rule

---

- Programming is writing functions to transform inputs (other functions or data) into outputs
- Good programming ensures the transformation is done easily and correctly
- Machines are made out of machines; functions are made out of functions, like $f(a,b) = a^2 + b^2$

> The trick to good programming is to take a big transformation and **break it down** into smaller ones, and then break those down, until you come to tasks which are easy (using built-in functions)

Before functions, data
====

At base level, all data can represented in binary format, by **bits** (i.e., TRUE/FALSE, YES/NO, 1/0). Basic data types:

- **Booleans**: Direct binary values: `TRUE` or `FALSE` in R
- **Integers**: whole numbers (positive, negative or zero), represented by a fixed-length block of bits
- **Characters**: fixed-length blocks of bits, with special coding; **strings**: sequences of characters
- **Floating point numbers**: an integer times a positive integer to the power of an integer, as in $3 \times 10^6$ or $1 \times 3^{-1}$
- **Missing or ill-defined values**: `NA`, `NaN`, etc.

Operators
====

- **Unary**: take just one argument. E.g., `-` for arithmetic negation, `!` for Boolean negation
- **Binary**: take two arguments. E.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` (though this is only a partial operator). Also, `%%` (for mod), and `^` (again partial)

```{r}
-7
7 + 5
7 - 5
```

---

```{r}
7 * 5
7 ^ 5
7 / 5
7 %% 5
```

Comparison operators
===

These are also binary operators; they take two objects, and give back a Boolean

```{r}
7 > 5
7 < 5
7 >= 7
```

---

```{r}
7 <= 5
7 == 5
7 != 5
```

Warning: `==` is a comparison operator, `=` is not!

Logical operators
===

These basic ones are `&` (and) and `|` (or)

```{r}
(5 > 7) & (6 * 7 == 42)
(5 > 7) | (6 * 7 == 42)
(5 > 7) | (6 * 7 == 42) & (0 != 0)
(5 > 7) | (6 * 7 == 42) & (0 != 0) | (9 - 8 >= 0)
```

Note: The double forms `&&` and `||` are different! We'll see them later

More types
===

- The `typeof()` function returns the data type
- `is.foo()` functions return Booleans for whether the argument is of type *foo*
- `as.foo()` (tries to) "cast" its argument to type *foo*, to translate it sensibly into such a value

```{r}
typeof(7)
is.numeric(7)
is.na(7)
is.na(7/0)
is.na(0/0)
```

---

```{r}
is.character(7)
is.character("7")
is.character("seven")
is.na("seven")
```

---

```{r}
as.character(5/6)
as.numeric(as.character(5/6))
6 * as.numeric(as.character(5/6))
5/6 == as.numeric(as.character(5/6))
```

Data can have names
===

We can give names to data objects; these give us **variables**. Some variables are built-in:

```{r}
pi
```

Variables can be arguments to functions or operators, just like constants:

```{r}
pi * 10
cos(pi)
```

---

We create variables with the **assignment operator**, `<-` or `=`

```{r}
approx.pi = 22/7
approx.pi
diameter = 10
approx.pi * diameter
```

The assignment operator also changes values:

```{r}
circumference = approx.pi * diameter
circumference
circumference = 30
circumference
```

---

- The code you write will be made of variables, with descriptive names
- Easier to design, easier to debug, easier to improve, and easier for others to read
- Avoid "magic constants"; instead use named variables 
- Named variables are a first step towards **abstraction**

R workspace
===

What variables have you defined?

```{r}
ls()
```

Getting rid of variables:

```{r}
rm("circumference")
ls()
rm(list=ls()) # Be warned! This erases everything
ls()
```

<span style="color: blue">Part II</span>
===

<span style="color: blue">*Data structures*</span>

First data structure: vectors
===

- A **data structure** is a grouping of related data values into an object
- A **vector** is a sequence of values, all of the same type

```{r}
x = c(7, 8, 10, 45)
x
is.vector(x)
```

- The `c()` function returns a vector containing all its arguments in  specified order
- `1:5` is shorthand for `c(1,2,3,4,5)`, and so on
- `x[1]` would be the first element, `x[4]` the fourth element, and `x[-4]` is a vector containing *all but* the fourth element

---

`vector(length=n)` returns an empty vector of length *n*; helpful for filling things up later

```{r}
weekly.hours = vector(length=5)
weekly.hours
weekly.hours[5] = 8
weekly.hours
```

Vector arithmetic
===

Arithmetic operator apply to vectors in a "componentwise" fashion

```{r}
y = c(-7, -8, -10, -45)
x + y
x * y
```

Recycling
===

**Recycling** repeat elements in shorter vector when combined with a longer one

```{r}
x + c(-7,-8)
x^c(1,0,-1,0.5)
```

Single numbers are vectors of length 1 for purposes of recycling:

```{r}
2 * x
```

---

Can do componentwise comparisons with vectors:

```{r}
x > 9
```

Logical operators also work elementwise:

```{r}
(x > 9) & (x < 20)
```

---

To compare whole vectors, best to use `identical()` or `all.equal()`:

```{r}
x == -y
identical(x, -y)
identical(c(0.5-0.3,0.3-0.1), c(0.3-0.1,0.5-0.3))
all.equal(c(0.5-0.3,0.3-0.1), c(0.3-0.1,0.5-0.3))
```

Note: these functions are slightly different; we'll see more later

Functions on vectors
===

Many functions can take vectors as arguments:

- `mean()`, `median()`, `sd()`, `var()`, `max()`, `min()`, 
`length()`, and `sum()` return single numbers
- `sort()` returns a new vector
- `hist()` takes a vector of numbers and produces a histogram, 
a highly structured object, with the side effect of making a plot
- `ecdf()` similarly produces a cumulative-density-function object
- `summary()` gives a five-number summary of numerical vectors
- `any()` and `all()` are useful on Boolean vectors

Indexing vectors
===

Vector of indices:

```{r}
x[c(2,4)]
```

Vector of negative indices:

```{r}
x[c(-1,-3)]
```

---

Boolean vector:

```{r}
x[x > 9]
y[x > 9]
```

`which()` gives the elements of a Boolean vector that are `TRUE`:

```{r}
places = which(x > 9)
places
y[places]
```

Named components
===

We can give names to elements/components of vectors, and index vectors accordingly

```{r}
names(x) = c("v1","v2","v3","fred")
names(x)
x[c("fred","v1")]
```

Note: here R is printing the labels, these are not additional components of `x`

---

`names()` returns another vector (of characters):

```{r}
names(y) = names(x)
sort(names(x))
which(names(x) == "fred")
```

Second data structure: arrays
===

An **array** is a multi-dimensional generalization of vectors

```{r}
x = c(7, 8, 10, 45)
x.arr = array(x, dim=c(2,2))
x.arr
```

- `dim` says how many rows and columns; filled by columns
- Can have 3d arrays, 4d arrays, etc.; `dim` is vector of arbitrary length

---

Some properties of our array:

```{r}
dim(x.arr)
is.vector(x.arr)
is.array(x.arr)
typeof(x.arr)
```

Indexing arrays
===

Can access a 2d array either by pairs of indices or by the underlying vector (column-major order):

```{r}
x.arr[1,2]
x.arr[3]
```

---

Omitting an index means "all of it":

```{r}
x.arr[c(1,2),2]
x.arr[,2]
x.arr[,2,drop=FALSE]
```

Note: the optional third argument `drop=FALSE` ensures that the result is still an array, not a vector

Functions on arrays
===

Many functions applied to an array will just boil things down to the underlying vector:

```{r}
which(x.arr > 9)
```

This happens unless the function is set up to handle arrays specifically

---

And there are several functions/operators that _do_ preserve array structure:

```{r}
y = -x
y.arr = array(y, dim=c(2,2))
y.arr + x.arr
```

2d arrays: matrices
===

A **matrix** is a specialization of a 2d array

```{r}
z.mat = matrix(c(40,1,60,3), nrow=2)
z.mat
is.array(z.mat)
is.matrix(z.mat)
```

- Could also specify `ncol` for the number of columns
- To fill by rows, use `byrow=TRUE` 
- Elementwise operations with the usual arithmetic and comparison operators (e.g., `z.mat/3`)

Matrix multiplication
===

Matrices have its own special multiplication operator, written `%*%`:

```{r}
six.sevens = matrix(rep(7,6), ncol=3)
six.sevens
z.mat %*% six.sevens # [2x2] * [2x3]
```

Can also multiply a matrix and a vector

Row/column manipulations
===

Row/column sums, or row/column means:

```{r}
rowSums(z.mat)
colSums(z.mat)
rowMeans(z.mat)
colMeans(z.mat)
```

Matrix diagonal
===

The `diag()` function can be used to extract the diagonal entries of a matrix:

```{r}
diag(z.mat)
```

It can also be used to change the diagonal:

```{r}
diag(z.mat) = c(35,4)
z.mat
```

Creating a diagonal matrix
===

Finally, `diag()` can be used to create a diagonal matrix:

```{r}
diag(c(3,4))
diag(2)
```

Other matrix operators
===

Transpose:

```{r}
t(z.mat)
```

Determinant:

```{r}
det(z.mat)
```

Inverse:

```{r}
solve(z.mat)
z.mat %*% solve(z.mat)
```

Names in matrices
===

- We can name either rows or columns or both, with `rownames()` and `colnames()`
- These are just character vectors, and we use them just like we do `names()` for vectors
- Names help us understand what we're working with 

Third data structure: lists
====

A **list** is sequence of values, but not necessarily all of the same type

```{r}
my.dist = list("exponential", 7, FALSE)
my.dist
```

Most of what you can do with vectors you can also do with lists

Accessing pieces of lists
===

- Can use `[ ]` as with vectors  
- Or use `[[ ]]`, but only with a single index `[[ ]]` drops names and structures, `[ ]` does not

```{r}
my.dist[2]
my.dist[[2]]
my.dist[[2]]^2
```

Expanding and contracting lists
===

Add to lists with `c()` (also works with vectors):

```{r}
my.dist = c(my.dist, 9)
my.dist
```

---

Chop off the end of a list by setting the length to something 
smaller (also works with vectors):

```{r}
length(my.dist)
length(my.dist) = 3
my.dist
```

---

Pluck out all but one piece of a list (also works with vectors):

```{r}
my.dist[-2]
```

Names in lists
===

We can name some or all of the elements of a list:

```{r}
names(my.dist) = c("family","mean","is.symmetric")
my.dist
my.dist[["family"]]
my.dist["family"]
```

---

Lists have a special shortcut way of using names, with `$`:

```{r}
my.dist[["family"]]
my.dist$family
```

---

Creating a list with names:

```{r}
another.dist = list(family="gaussian", mean=7, sd=1, is.symmetric=TRUE)
```

Adding named elements:

```{r}
my.dist$was.estimated = FALSE
my.dist[["last.updated"]] = "2021-01-01"
```

Removing a named list element, by assigning it the value `NULL`:

```{r}
my.dist$was.estimated = NULL
```

Key-value pairs
===

- Lists give us a natural way to store and look up data by _name_, rather than by _position_
- A really useful programming concept with many names: **key-value pairs**, i.e., **dictionaries**, or **associative arrays**
- If all our distributions have components named `family`, we can look that up by name, without caring where it is (in what position it lies) in the list

Data frames
===

- The classic data table, $n$ rows for cases, $p$ columns for variables
- Lots of the really-statistical parts of R presume data frames  
- Not just a matrix because _columns can have different types_
- Many matrix functions also work for data frames (e.g.,`rowSums()`, `summary()`, `apply()`)

```{r}
a.mat = matrix(c(35,8,10,4), nrow=2)
colnames(a.mat) = c("v1","v2")
a.mat
a.mat[,"v1"]  # Try a.mat$v1 and see what happens
```

---

```{r}
a.df = data.frame(a.mat,logicals=c(TRUE,FALSE))
a.df
a.df$v1
a.df[,"v1"]
a.df[1,]
colMeans(a.df)
```

Adding rows and columns
===

We can add rows or columns to an array or data frame with `rbind()` and `cbind()`, but be careful about forced type conversions

```{r}
rbind(a.df,list(v1=-3,v2=-5,logicals=TRUE))
rbind(a.df,c(3,4,6))
```

Much more on data frames a bit later in the course ...

Structures of structures
===

So far, every list element has been a single data value. List elements can be other data structures, e.g., vectors and matrices, even other lists:

```{r}
my.list = list(z.mat=z.mat, my.lucky.num=13, my.dist=my.dist)
my.list
```

Summary
===

- We write programs by composing functions to manipulate data
- The basic data types let us represent Booleans, numbers, and characters
- Data structures let us group together related values 
- Vectors let us group values of the same type
- Arrays add multi-dimensional structure to vectors
- Matrices act like you'd hope they would
- Lists let us combine different types of data
- Data frames are hybrids of matrices and lists, allowing each column to have a different data type
