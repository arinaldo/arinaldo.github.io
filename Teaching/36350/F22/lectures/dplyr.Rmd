Last week: Purrr and a bit of dplyr
===

- The tidyverse is a collection of packages for common data science tasks
- `purrr` is one such package that provides a consistent family of iteration functions
- `map()`: list in, list out
- `map_dbl()`, `map_lgl()`, `map_chr()`: list in, vector out (of a particular data type)
- `map_dfr()`, `map_dfc()`: list in, data frame out (row-binded or column-binded)
- `dplyr` is another such package that provides functions for data frame computations
- `filter()`: subset rows based on a condition
- `group_by()`: define groups of rows according to a condition
- `summarize()`: apply computations across groups of rows

What is the tidyverse?
===

The tidyverse is a coherent collection of packages in R for data science (and `tidyverse` is itself a actually package that loads all its constituent packages). Packages include:

- **Data wrangling**: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`
- **Iteration**: `purrr`
- **Visualization**: `ggplot2`

Last week we covered `purrr` and a bit of `dplyr`. This week we'll do more `dplyr`, and some `tidyr`. (Many of you will learn `ggplot2` in Statistical Graphics 36-315)

Loading the tidyverse so that we can get all this functionality (plus more): 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Why the tidyverse?
===

- Packages have a very consistent API
- Very active developer and user community
- Function names and commands follow a focused **grammar**
- Powerful and fast when working with data frames and lists (matrices, not so much, yet!)
- Pipes (`%>%` operator) allows us to fluidly glue functionality together
- At its best, tidyverse code can be **read like a story** using the pipe operator!

Data wrangling the tidy way
===

- Packages `dplyr` and `tidyr` are going to be our main workhorses for data wrangling
- Main structure these packages use is the data frame (or tibble, but we won't go there)
- Learning pipes `%>%` will facilitate learning the `dplyr` and `tidyr` verbs (functions) 
- `dplyr` functions are analogous to SQL counterparts, so learn `dplyr` and get SQL for free!

<span style="color: blue">*Mastering the pipe*</span>

All behold the glorius pipe 
===

- Tidyverse functions are at their best when composed together using the pipe operator
- It looks like this: `%>%`. **Shortcut**: use `ctrl + shift + m` in RStudio
- This operator actually comes from the `magrittr` package (automatically included in `dplyr`)
- **Piping** at its most basic level: 

    > Take one return value and automatically feed it in as an input to another function, to form a flow of results

- In unix and related systems, we also have pipes, as in:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls -l | grep tidy | wc -l
```

How to read pipes: single arguments
===

Passing a single argument through pipes, we interpret something like:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x %>% f %>% g %>% h
```

as `h(g(f(x)))`

**Key takeaway**: in your mind, when you see `%>%`, read this as **"and then"**

Simple example
===

We can write `exp(1)` with pipes as `1 %>% exp`, and `log(exp(1))` as `1 %>% exp %>% log`

```{r}
exp(1)
1 %>% exp
1 %>% exp %>% log
```

How to read pipes: multiple arguments
===

Now for multi-arguments functions, we interpret something like:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x %>% f(y) 
```

as `f(x,y)`

Simple example
===

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>% head(4) 
```

And what's the "old school" (base R) way?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(mtcars, 4)
```

Notice that, with pipes:  

- Your code is more readable (arguably)  
- You can run partial commands more easily

The dot
===

The command `x %>% f(y)` can be equivalently written in **dot notation** as:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x %>% f(., y)
```

What's the advantage of using dots? Sometimes you want to pass in a variable as the *second* or *third* (say, not first) argument to a function, with a pipe. As in:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x %>% f(y, .)
```

which is equivalent to `f(y,x)`

Simple example
===

Again, see if you can interpret the code below without running it, then run it in your R console as a way to check your understanding:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
state_df = data.frame(state.x77)
state.region %>% 
  tolower %>%
  tapply(state_df$Income, ., summary)
```

A more complicated example:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
x = "Prof Rinaldo really loves piping"
x %>% 
  strsplit(split = " ") %>% 
  .[[1]] %>% # indexing, could also use `[[`(1)
  nchar %>% 
  max 
```

<span style="color: blue">*`dyplr` verbs*</span>

`dplyr` verbs 
===

Some of the most important `dplyr` verbs (functions):

- `filter()`: subset rows based on a condition
- `group_by()`: define groups of rows according to a condition
- `summarize()`: apply computations across groups of rows
- `arrange()`: order rows by value of a column
- `select()`: pick out given columns
- `mutate()`: create new columns
- `mutate_at()`: apply a function to given columns

We've learned `filter()`, `group_by()`, `summarize()` in the last lecture. (Go back and rewrite the examples using pipes!)

`arrange()`: order rows by values of a column
===

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  arrange(mpg) %>% 
  head(4)

# Base R
mpg_inds = order(mtcars$mpg)
head(mtcars[mpg_inds, ], 4)
```

---

We can ask for descending order:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  arrange(desc(mpg)) %>% 
  head(4)

# Base R
mpg_inds_decr = order(mtcars$mpg, decreasing = TRUE)
head(mtcars[mpg_inds_decr, ], 4)
```

---

We can order by multiple columns too:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  arrange(desc(gear), desc(hp)) %>%
  head(8)
```

`select()`: pick out given columns
===

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  select(cyl, disp, hp) %>% 
  head(2)

# Base R
head(mtcars[, c("cyl", "disp", "hp")], 2)
```

Some handy `select()` helpers
===

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  select(starts_with("d")) %>% 
  head(2)

# Base R (yikes!)
d_colnames = grep(x = colnames(mtcars), pattern = "^d")
head(mtcars[, d_colnames], 2)
```

---

We can do many other things as well:

```{r}
mtcars %>% select(ends_with('t')) %>% head(2)
mtcars %>% select(ends_with('yl')) %>% head(2)
mtcars %>% select(contains('ar')) %>% head(2)
```

(If you're interested go and read more [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html#useful-functions))

`mutate()`: create one or several columns
===

```{r}
mtcars = mtcars %>% 
  mutate(hp_wt = hp/wt, 
         mpg_wt = mpg/wt) 

# Base R
mtcars$hp_wt = mtcars$hp/mtcars$wt
mtcars$mpg_wt = mtcars$mpg/mtcars$wt
```

---

Newly created variables are useable immediately:

```{r}
mtcars = mtcars %>% 
  mutate(hp_wt_again = hp/wt,
         hp_wt_cyl = hp_wt_again/cyl) 

# Base R
mtcars$hp_wt_again = mtcars$hp/mtcars$wt
mtcars$hp_wt_cyl = mtcars$hp_wt_again/mtcars$cyl
```

`mutate_at()`: apply a function to one or several columns
===

```{r}
mtcars = mtcars %>% 
  mutate_at(c("hp_wt", "mpg_wt"), log) 

# Base R
mtcars$hp_wt = log(mtcars$hp_wt)
mtcars$mpg_wt = log(mtcars$mpg_wt)
```

Important note
===

Calling `dplyr` verbs always outputs a new data frame, it *does not alter* the existing data frame

So to keep the changes, we have to reassign the data frame to be the output of the pipe! (Look back at the examples for `mutate()` and `mutate_at()`)

`dplyr` and SQL
===

- Once you learn `dplyr` you should find SQL very natural, and vice versa!
- For example, `select` is `SELECT`, `filter` is `WHERE`, `arrange` is `ORDER BY` etc.
- This will make it much easier for tasks that require using both R and SQL to munge data and build statistical models
- One major link is through powerful verbs like `group_by()` and `summarize()`, which are used to aggregate data (next lecture)
- Another major link to SQL is through merging/joining data frames, via `left_join()` and `inner_join()` verbs (which we'll learn later)

<span style="color: blue">Part IV</span>

<span style="color: blue">*`tidyr` verbs*</span>

`tidyr` verbs 
===

Two of the most important `tidyr` verbs (functions):

- `pivot_longer()`: make "wide" data longer 
- `pivot_wider()`: make "long" data wider

There are many others like `spread()`, `gather()`, `nest()`, `unnest()`, etc. (If you're interested go and read about them [here](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html))

`pivot_longer()`: make "wide" data longer
===

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#devtools::install_github("rstudio/EDAWR") or remotes::install_github("rstudio/EDAWR")
library(EDAWR) # Load some nice data sets
EDAWR::cases 

EDAWR::cases %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "n", 
               cols = 2:4) 
```

---

- Here we transposed columns 2:4 into a `year` column 
- We put the corresponding count values into a column called `n`
- Note `tidyr` did all the heavy lifting of the transposing work
- We just had to declaratively specify the output

---

```{r}
# Different approach to do the same thing
EDAWR::cases %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "n", 
               -country) 

# Could also do: 
# EDAWR::cases %>% 
#   pivot_longer(names_to = "year", 
#                values_to = "n", 
#                c(`2011`, `2012`, `2013`)) 
```

`pivot_wider()`: make "long" data wider
===

```{r}
EDAWR::pollution

EDAWR::pollution %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "size", 
              values_from = "amount")
```

---

- Here we transposed to a wide format by size 
- We tabulated the corresponding amount for each size
- Note `tidyr` did all the heavy lifting again
- We just had to declaratively specify the output 
- Note that `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` are inverses
