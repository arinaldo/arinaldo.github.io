<br>
This is a core Ph.D. course in theoretical statistics.
We will cover a selection of modern topics in mathematical statistics, with
a focus on high-dimensional statistical models and non-parametric statistical
models. One of the main goals of this course is to
provide you with some theoretical background and mathematical tools to read and
understand
the current statistical literature on high-dimensional models. 
<!--

This course is the first of a sequence of two minis intended to introduce Ph.d. students in
 Statistics and Machine Learning to some of the mathematical tools
 used in the analysis of high-dimensional statistical models.
 <br>
In big-data problems, it is often the case that the statistical complexity of a
single datum is increasing in the sample size. 
In these instances, the classical statistical modeling approach, which is
predicated on the assumption
that the number of model parameters  remains fixed as the sample size grows
unbounded, is no longer applicable. In contrast, high-dimensional statistical
models allow for the number of model parameters to change with the sample size,
so
that, as more data are gathered, models of increasing complexity and predictive
power
 can be used. 
 In order to formalize statistical tasks and evaluate the theoretical
 performance of
 statistical procedures  in  high-dimensional settings, it is necessary to
 use a different suite of techniques and theories than in traditional
 statistics.
 <br>
 The learning objectives of this course are two-fold.
 The first goal is present various concentration 
 inequalities techniques to derive finite sample upper bounds on the performance of
 high-dimensional
 algorithms. 
 The second goal is to exemplify the use of such techniques on various problems
 borrowed from the current literature, including high-dimensional regression and
 compressed sensing, matrix
 completion,  high-dimensional graphical modeling,
 community detection, network analysis, etc.
